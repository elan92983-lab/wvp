\subsection{Variational Quantum Optimization}
QAOA \cite{farhi2014qaoa} is a widely studied VQA. Recent work explores parameter initialization and transfer learning, including GNN-based parameter prediction \cite{joshi2022qaoa}.

\subsection{Feedback-Based Quantum Control}
FALQON \cite{magann2022feedback} and follow-up work \cite{magann2022lyapunov} propose feedback rules that avoid classical optimization. Our neural approach complements FALQON by providing fast zero-shot parameter generation.

\subsection{Spectral Graph Representation Learning}
Spectral graph features provide a principled input; SignNet \cite{lim2023signnet} addresses eigenvector sign ambiguity and is adapted here.
