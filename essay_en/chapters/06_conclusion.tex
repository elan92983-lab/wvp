We introduced a Spectral-Temporal Transformer for predicting FALQON control parameters in a teacher-student zero-shot framework. Key findings:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Feasibility: On convergent samples the model achieves Corr = 0.917, validating neural prediction of quantum control parameters.
  \item Limitations: Oscillatory samples (often from regular graphs) exhibit high-frequency behavior that is harder to predict.
  \item Theoretical guarantee: Lyapunov analysis shows that as long as prediction errors do not flip control signs, the system remains convergent.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Scale tests to larger graphs ($n>20$) to examine cross-size generalization.
  \item Explore hybrid strategies that combine neural predictions with physics-based refinement.
  \item Evaluate performance on noisy quantum hardware models.
\end{itemize}
